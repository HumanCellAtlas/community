# Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform - Our Strategy

## Specific Aims

### Aim 1

**Create a data resource that maximizes the value and use of Human Cell Atlas data across the scientific community.**

1. Collect all data considered suitable towards building the Human Cell Atlas into the DCP, ensure it is organised according to FAIR principles, and ensure it meets desired standards of QC
2. Encourage labs to adopt and incorporate HCA standards into their data generation practices, e.g. by recording protocols in protocols.io and registering project metadata as soon as a project is started, to avoid “lossy” conversions
3. Provide the means, and a standard policy, for using and citing HCA data (for example by providing stable accession numbers or DOIs) that encourages data provenance, reproducibility, and increases exposure of DCP resources

### Aim 2

**Provide researchers access to data that will enable the Human Cell Atlas to answer fundamental questions in all aspects of biology.**

1. Provide access to useable data (raw, processed and analysed) with informative metadata via APIs and a website-based user interface
2. Ensure an intuitive and consistent experience whilst accessing DCP data and metadata, either via APIs or user interfaces
3. Deliver search capability and summary information over DCP datasets, via APIs or user interfaces, that are centred on the needs of researchers who will draft tissue specific atlases and the Human Cell Atlas

### Aim 3

**Perform regular data releases of high value to single cell researchers.**

1. Deliver regular releases of all data in the DCP that passes latest quality controls
2. Provide regular releases of specific data subsets in the DCP that can be used to reproduce analyses, including (for example) the drafting of tissue specific atlases
3. Regularly migrate experimental design descriptions (including metadata) to the latest standards, and flag non-conformant data for manual review. Exclude non-conformant it from future releases until it has been curated
4. Periodically reprocess and reanalyse data using the latest pipelines in the DCP
Provide access to previous DCP releases via APIs and user interfaces that present the same experience as the current versions

### Aim 4

**Build alignment amongst the Human Cell Atlas community around a core set of computational methods and analyses.**

1. Provide reports on the most commonly used technologies based on relative quantities of data in the DCP, allowing the community to evaluate whether the data in the DCP is reflective of trends and technology choices in the community at large
2. Focus on delivery of processing pipelines and analysis support for the technologies that are most commonly utilised by the Human Cell Atlas community
3. Deliver a core set of data processing pipelines and analysis methods that are endorsed by the analysis working group
4. Support community-contributed pipelines for data processing and analysis.

### Aim 5

**Create standards for the community to use to describe single cell experimental designs, including assay types, data and metadata.**

1. Characterise, describe and validate the set of known single cell experiment designs and ensure these are associated with measures of impact (e.g. QC scores, or description in a publication)
2. Support scientists to make direct comparisons of DCP data in order to identify the best methods and protocols for drafting the Human Cell Atlas
3. Define standards for describing experimental designs, biological materials, analysis methods and data files formats, focusing on the features that are known to be valuable when characterising cell types
4. Ensure DCP standards are interoperable with, or aligned to, established community standards outside of the DCP and the HCA wherever possible
