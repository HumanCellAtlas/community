# Table of Contents Grandfathering Former Design Decisions and Documents

## Summary

This RFC details a table of contents containing pointers to previous, relevant design decisions and documents that were made and created prior to the formalization of the current [RFC process](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/blob/master/rfcs/text/0001-rfc-process.md).

## Motivation

Prior to debut of the [RFC process](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/blob/master/rfcs/text/0001-rfc-process.md) a number of design decisions were made for the DCP Architecture that are still valuable to reference. Oftentime these documents are hard to find in the depths of the DCP Google Drive. This Informational RFC pulls important design documents that are still relevant as of the creation of this RFC and references them in a table of contents format here.

### User Stories

* As a DCP developer, I would like to remember and recall certain design decisions that impact the current DCP architecture and be able to find the designs with ease.
