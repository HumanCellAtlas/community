### DCP PR:

***Leave this blank until the RFC is approved** then the **Author(s)** must create a link between the assigned RFC number and this pull request in the format:*

`[dcp-community/rfc#](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/pull/<PR#>)`

# DCP Product Roadmap YYYY

*Change `YYYY` to the target year for the Roadmap such as `2020`*

## Summary

*Describe the highlights of the Roadmap in 2-3 sentences. Consider this section as your "elevator pitch" or "release note" to the community.*

## Author(s)

*Recommended format for Authors:*

 `[Name](mailto:username@example.com)`

*This could be individual authors or the DCP Project Leads mailing list.*

## Shepherd
*This role MUST be assigned to the Roadmap Shepherd to guide the **Author(s)** through the RFC process.*

*Recommended format for Shepherds:*

 `[Name](mailto:username@example.com)`

## Scientific "guardrails"

*Summarize the overall alignment with the Science Roadmap and include a reference to the Roadmap*

## Theme 1

*Provide a detailed overview of the Theme that provides context and information.*

*Bad example*:
> The DCP needs an efficient data workflow

*This theme does not describe the “why” behind the work, which speaks to the value the user will derive from the work being completed. Without the “why”, the theme is relegated to a list of needs that aren’t able to be understood or executed upon well.*

*Better example*:
> The DCP needs an efficient data workflow in order to provide users with timely and reliable data.

**Theme**: *Short name for the Theme such as "Harmonized data"*

**Prioritization**: *"Critical", "Important", or "Nice to Have"*

**Accountable**: *Recommended format is*`[Name](mailto:username@example.com)`

**Contacts**: *Recommended format is*`[Name](mailto:username@example.com)`

**References**: *Links to supporting material*

### Objective 1

*Document high-level Objectives that are achieved by the completion of the Theme*

*Bad examples*:
> Objective 1: Have a data and troubleshooting tool

> Objective 2: Outline all existing validation steps across all components in a centralized document first and then create all possible (required, nice to have, etc) validation processes and steps in the data workflow

 *The first objective is far too vague, not concrete, and doesn’t provide an actionable path forward for further scoping, design, or execution. The second objective provides far too much detail, which limits the team’s abilities to create and implement novel solutions and disenfranchises those not involved in the creation of the objective.*

*Better examples*:
> Objective 1: Establish end-to-end data tracking and troubleshooting protocol

> Objective 2: Identify existing and needed validation steps in the data workflow
 

#### User Story
#### User Value

*Document how this Objective delivers value to specific [HCA Personas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bsu8q9CzRXv3Y8c1p8NENi3p8KlxC4scp2tJkHO3Jeo/edit#slide=id.g3cf4e46e8f_0_38).*

#### Deliverable to be Demonstrated


#### Objective Dependencies

*Document dependencies on other Objectives for completion. For example, indicate whether the Objectives in a Theme must be addressed in order because each Objective is a "slice" that builds on a previous Objective.*

### Objective 2
#### User Story
#### User Value
#### Deliverable to be Demonstrated
#### Objective Dependencies

### Components

*Document the list of components required to execute the Theme*

### Risks

*Doument risks that could block or prevent the completion of a Themes and its Objectives*

### Theme Dependencies

*Document dependencies on other Themes or Objectives for completion.*
