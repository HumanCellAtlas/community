# RFC Name

Experimental Data Structure Conceptual Model

## Summary

This document described the conceptual model of the HCA DCP experimental data and associated metadata.  This is an informational RFC that covers how to interpret the experimental data graph considering multiple versions of the data and metadata.  If does not cover content-specifics, including schema or storage format.

## Motivation
The goal of the experimental metadata is to capture a detailed, accurate representation of the experimental process and the scientific data within the DCP.  The experimental metadata is closely coupled to the experimental data and expected to evolve as experimental methods and consumer needs evolve.

The full scientific data content of the DCP is represented by the experimental metadata model, including all versions of data and metadata instances.  Programmatic access to all versions of metadata is needed to allow for exploration and analysis of the provenance of HCA data.

The addition of data and metadata update functionality (AUDR) has increased the complexity of the data model. A rigorous definition of the full data model is need to be able to both communicate about and to interpret the versioned graph in a consistent and accurate manner.


### User Stories

As a DCP developer, in order to develop software to manage versioned data,
I would like to understand how to interpret the data and communicate with other developers in an precise manner.

As a data operations engineer, in order to construct a data release, I would like to understand what specific data and metadata instances to include.

As a bioinformatation, in order to replicate an experiment, I would like to understand the provenance of the relevant data files from a data release.

## Detailed Design

The experimental metadata is structured as DAG of instances, with basic categories of Projects, Biomaterials, Protocols, Processes, and Files.  Each of these types may have more detailed derived types.  This structure is defined in more detail in [Overview of Metadata Structure](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema/blob/master/docs/structure.md)..

Conceptually, the full, versioned metadata graph consists of all metadata instance versions in the DCP  However, there are multiple ways to traverse the graph based on the question being asked:


* Head graph: The top-down traversal of the most current version of metadata instances.  This does not include obsolete instances.  This view of the graph is normally used for browser and selection of the latest results
* Provenance graph: This is the reverse-traversal graph from a specific version of a metadata instance, visiting the exact versions of preceding metadata instances.  This is records the context of an experiment when it was run.
* Amended provenance graph: The provenance graph with corrections that are inconsequential, such as correcting natural language descriptions.  This graph is used to produce data releases.


The head graph is the graph of the latest version of all of the metadata, excluding those that eew obsolete due to a restructuring update or those that are flagged as erroneous.  This is the view normally used in selectinzÎ©g data sets and exploring the atlas.  Traversing from the roots to result in a branching set of paths to the leaves.  Normally, this graph would be generated by traversing via UUID, ignored the version timestamps.


The providence graph gives the exact history of data and metadata as it existed at the time a given process was run.  This view provides the ability to analyze and understand an experiment.  It is a reverse traversal from leaves to roots following FQIDs of the input to each metadata instance as it existed at the time the leaf was created.  Since metadata indirectly upstream of a process may change without intermediary processes being rerun, the providence links are not simply the version of the direct input to a node at the time each metadata entity was created.  The upstream metadata change may have triggered a downstream rerun without intermediate processes being rerun.

The knowledge if an update will result in a new or amended analysis is not known by the ingestion process.  It will be determined by each analysis examining the update.

Figures 1-4 are some examples to illustrate the graph interpretation issues.  In each of these drawings, the graph node labels starting with B are biomaterials, those with P are processes, and with F are files.  The first number is the unique id, which is a UUID in practice.  The number after the dot is the version, which is actually represented as a timestamp.  Red squiggles indicate an outdated metadata instance.

Figure 1: Basic graph of sequencing and analysis.  This is a basic experimental pipeline with no updates. The head graph is obtained by traversing the graph from the root to the leaves   The provenance of a given leaf is achieved by reverse traversing the edges.

Figure 2: Graph with an updated analysis.  In this case, an analysis is rerun for a reason other than an upstream change.  For example, this could be due to a bug be discovered in the analysis software.  The head graph is obtained by traversing the graph, ignoring the outdated nodes.  The provenance graph is obtained by reverse traversing the edges shown in red.

Figure 3: Graph with a new analysis:  In this case, a second, independent analysis is run.  This might be the case when a new different analysis algorithm is being used.  The head graph includes both analysis results.   The provenance graph is obtained by reverse traversing the edges shown in red.


![](../images/0000-reanalysis-graph.png)

Figure 4: Graph with an upstream consequential metadata change that triggers a reanalysis.  This is the case where there is an error in a metadata field that is used to parameterize the analysis. Here the sequencing didn't change, however, the downstream analysis was triggered by a change in the biomaterial metadata (B1).  The provenance graph reverse traverses the edges shown in red, going to B1.2 even though the process metadata P1.1 has not changed.


![](../images/0000-amended-graph.png)

Figure 5: Graph with an upstream inconsequential metadata change that does not trigger a reanalysis.   Correcting natural-language descriptions or migrating the metadata schema are examples of this type of update. 
Reverse-traversing the read edges gives the amended provenance graph.


The project metadata entity is as a container for all metadata and data that is part of the project.  All data in the DCP belongs to at least one project.  It is possible that a given metadata instance will be associated with more than one project, such as a sample sequenced by multiple projects. Derived projects can be create for an analysis that used data from multiple project.
