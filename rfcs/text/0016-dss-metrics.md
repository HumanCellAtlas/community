# RFC: Key performance metrics of the DCP Data Store (DSS)

## Summary

This RFC proposes a set of key performance metrics to be introduced and tracked as a summary measure of performance by
which the utility of the Data Store can be evaluated, and by which informed data-driven improvement and/or regression
decisions may be made.

## Motivation

Today, the DSS only tracks latency and error rates, which alone, do not provide a full picture of its utility nor allow
us to quantify higher level performance metrics that reflect the Data Store's ability to make HCA data accessible,
computable, and durable.

This RFC introduces a first iteration of DSS-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used to make DSS
performance more measurable, and changes more observable and actionable. The suggested set of metrics is intended to be
mutable; the service team should adjust and expand the set over time while ensuring observability is not negatively
impacted.

The RFC is also intended as a model for establishing service-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and preparing
them for roll-up into DCP-wide KPIs.

### User Stories

* As a DSS developer, I would like to know whether the DSS is improving in its ability to serve downstream users and
  services.

* As a downstream service developer, I would like to suggest a way of measuring DSS performance that reflects my ability
  to use the DSS to consume HCA data.

* As a DCP funder, I would like to know how the DSS is balancing the goals of economical data storage and data
  accessibility and computability.

## Detailed Design

Introduce infrastructure (such as logging, instrumentation, offline log analytics, etc.) to measure the following DSS
performance metrics in 3 categories:

- *API performance metrics*: Measure TTFB (time to first byte) along with any dimensions that affect checkout service
  behavior (file type, size, etc.), User Agent string, and other relevant request data. Time to first byte is defined
  here as the time from the first request to access a bundle or file to the time of the first request that returns a
  pre-signed or direct object storage access URL. (This may require an opaque session identifier to be returned when
  serving responses with a Retry-After header.)

  Units: seconds

- *Error metrics*: Measure unrecoverable error rate, i.e. the rate of error that caused the client to stop trying and
  cause a client-side error to be raised. (This may require instrumentation in the HCA CLI.)

  Units: rate (number of API requests raising ultimate error (rolled up with their retries) / total API requests)

- *Costing metrics*: Measure "all-in" cost per GB stored (the total cost of DSS services provided divided by the number
  of GB stored in each replica). Other metrics or breakout categories could be needed here, such as breaking out and
  tracking transfer or subscription notification costs separately, but only if and when it is shown that such costs are
  a significant component of the overall cost footprint.

  Units: US$/GB

Measure the above metrics on both AWS and GCP, separately and in composite (weighted average).

A blend of these metrics can be thought of as the key performance indicator (KPI) for the Data Store to optimize. More
metrics shouldbe added or changed in each category over time, provided that observability of the system is not reduced.
