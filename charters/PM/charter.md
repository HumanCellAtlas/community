# PM (_Program, Product, or Project Management_) Team Charter

## Description

The Data Coordination Platform (DCP) PM team is responsible for the oversight of the DCP *as product*, developing the shared understanding of the overall product vision, priorities, and release schedule with the community.

The core team is composed of *Project Leads* and *Product Owners* from each DCP project, *DCP UX* (Voice of the Customer), and a *Science Program Manager*.

## Definitions

### Project Lead

When a DCP charter is approved, the community explictly delegates authority and leadership for a specific project and its scope to a **Project Lead**. The **Project Lead** is responsible for clearly defining and communicating the long-term vision and direction of their project.

Similar to [Mozilla module owners](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/module-ownership/), **Project Leads** are never *tyrants*. They are chartered to make decisions for their DCP project with input from the community and in the best interests of the community. 

### Product Owner
As adapted from the [Scrum process](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-po), a **Product Owner** manages the [Product Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog) for their DCP project including:
>* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
>* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
>* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
>* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
>* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed

**NOTE**: The responsibilities of the **Project Lead** and **Product Owner** are tightly intertwined. At an overly simplistic level, the **Project Lead** is more responsible for strategic objectives while the **Product Owner** drives tactical execution. In actual practice, it is a close partnership when planning and coordinating development with other projects.

### Science Program Manager

The **Science Program Manager** is the formal liaison for requests between HCA Science Leadership and the DCP community.
