# Query Service

## Description
The Query Service is an Application Programming Interface (API) for querying Human Cell Atlas (HCA) bundle metadata with intuitive query syntax.

Services the Query Module provides may complement or subsume the current search functionality in the Data Storage Service (DSS).

## Objectives
1. Build, operate, and maintain a metadata API query service that allows a variety of queries to be performed against bundle metadata stored in HCA Data Coordination Platform (DCP) DSS
1. Develop a query language specification for intuitive querying of HCA metadata by DCP developers and tertiary analysis app developers
1. Conduct user experience (UX) research to validate query language usability, understand remaining usability gaps in DCP data searchability and discoverability
1. Develop a scalable public API for external indexing and other DSS event consumers
1. Deploy all query systems as stand-alone, modular services
1. Make DCP index and query systems agnostic to DCP schema evolution

### Users

Query Service features will be developed with use cases of the following users in mind.

* Bioinformaticians
* Computational Biologists
* Portal Developers

## In-scope
* Common index event bus and deployment infrastructure
    * Finalize support for multiple metadata indexers in DSS
    * Expose event bus for bundle lifecycle event subscriptions
    * Scalable, fault-tolerant queuing mechanism for loading bundle lifecycle events
* Provide new iteration of or replace DSS [ElasticSearch (ES)](https://www.elastic.co) index and [query language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_introducing_the_query_language.html)
    * Stand-alone ES search service, integrated into search plugin interface
    * Increase isolation from metadata schema evolution
* Investigate new index technologies that provide intuitive queries of HCA metadata
    * Stand-alone query service, integrated into search plugin interface
    * [Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) metadata query prototype and pilot release
        * Socialize with community, investigate use cases, and determine utility of SQL query for these use cases
        * If prototype is viable, implement on the pluggable API, and launch as separate DCP service
    * Database service configuration and deployment infrastructure
    * ETL layer and database schema design
* Query access service API and query language
    * Public API for modular query engine plugins
    * In collaboration with the Expression Matrix Service, determine how Query and consumer API interact and are made complementary
* Documentation
    * Documentation for API and query language use with metadata
    * Demonstration use of service; developer example code to enable fast and easy third party adoption of API
* UX Research and Feedback
    * UX validation of API and query language with the analysis application community
    * Provide feedback to DCP about public API suitability in building layered services (e.g. can a new Query microservice be built using only public DSS API?)
    * Provide feedback to the metadata group on schema changes that could support intuitive queries of the metadata

## Out-of-scope
* Search user interface, search application and/or analysis application work
* Upkeep and improvement of existing indexers or ETL layers within DSS

## Milestones and Deliverables

* **EOY 2018**
    * Architectural work done
    * pilot/preview implementation of SQL query framework
    * feature complete, suitable for use in UX research, but not scalable
* **Early 2019**
    * DSS ES migrated to public API
    * improved resilience to metadata schema evolution
* **Mid-2019**
    * Performant, highly scalable version, suitable for interactive data serving across entire HCA data corpus
