# Compliance Working Group Charter


## Description

The Data Coordination Platform (DCP) Compliance Working Group is responsible for oversight of regulatory and security compliance of the DCP product. It will develop guidance to achieve and maintain compliance standards that promote data access and usability while also providing a secure product and appropriate data protections. The Compliance Working Group will also provide requirements to the DCP PM team for supporting the storage and processing of Managed Access data. Guidance from the Compliance Working Group will be applied to DevSecOps practices.


## Objectives

The Compliance Working Group is accountable for coordination, leadership, and oversight of DCP DevSecOps across all projects and operating platforms or environments. The Compliance Working Group aims to provide regulatory and security compliance frameworks that will be implemented through technical and policy-based solutions which enable the responsible sharing of genomic data. 

The Compliance Working Group recognizes the value of open access data to enable the community to pursue the goals of the HCA and better understand our own cellular identity and heterogeneity. This group will make recommendations that reduce barriers to data access where possible and will ensure that the process for gaining access to data that cannot be shared without barriers is as straightforward as possible. 

Where suitable and appropriate to follow, the Compliance Working Group will recommend standards defined by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), a program that has been working in this space for more than five years. 


## Definitions

__Open acccess data__ - Data which can be accessed without needing to identify yourself and without any authorization barriers

__Managed access data__ - Data which can be released only to the individuals who have been given permission to access it via a Data Access Committee (DAC)

__Data Access Committee__ - A committee of researchers who can make access right decisions about a dataset

__DevSecOps Team__ - DCP will soon charter a DevSecOps team that will be responsible for ensuring that application and infrastructure security are considered throughout each phase of the software development lifecycle and that DCP compliance, security operations, and development operations are in alignment.

## In-scope

_Governance_

* Develops standards and best practices for the DCP community in support of:
  * Security compliance
  * Application security
  * Privacy rules (e.g., GDPR)
* Approves standards and best practices in support of the above for DCP systems
* Audits adherence to standards developed by this working group and ratified by the DCP community

_Communication_
* Delivers a bi-annual DevSecOps readiness and gap report aligning to the developed frameworks. These reports will be published to the DCP community.
* Communicates key cloud operations performance metrics to program stakeholders

## Out-of-scope

The Compliance Working Group will not dictate the use of specific technological tools or services if more than one available option meets all requirements.

## Legal and Regulatory Guardrails

The Compliance Working Group has members from the HCA ethics committee and an observer from the HCA DCP legal team. Working Group leadership will ensure these groups are always represented as part of the membership and that recommendations which have legal and/or ethical impact are appropriately reviewed and when given to the PM team the consequences of the impact is covered.

## Milestones and Deliverables

The Compliance Working Group will deliver a __holistic compliance framework__ that will inform compliance-based policies, standards, and processes (e.g., incident response, contingency planning, configuration management, log management and alerting, vulnerability management, application security standards, and user training requirements) as well as technical operational processes (e.g., perimeter security, secrets management, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and release processes).

The Compliance Working Group will deliver:
* A collection of documentation which describes the security posture of the program, the technical implementation of security controls, and processes which internal and external users of the product shall follow,
* A roadmap of key focus areas per quarter that will be used to guide quarterly improvements to system technical security and overall compliance, and
* A bi-annual DevSecOps readiness and gap report aligning to the developed frameworks.
